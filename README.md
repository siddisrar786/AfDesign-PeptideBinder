# AfDesign-PeptideBinder
Designed an 8-mer peptide binder targeting 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase (PDB: 2H6U_A) using AlphaFold-based AfDesign. Automated structure optimization, binding interface evaluation, and mutation sampling were integrated. Includes PyMOL visualization, pLDDT analysis, and binder affinity prediction pipeline.
